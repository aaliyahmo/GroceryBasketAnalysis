# Grocery Store Basket Analysis
Basket Analysis of a grocery store. Data taken from Kaggle. 

### Intro:
A Basket Analysis or Market Basket Analysis, takes a look at the ways certain objects or in this case, grocery items, are bought together. It makes you take a look at what the customer is buying and products are related and in turn, helps the store find patterns. A common example is people buying bread and milk. 

This dataset is a small dataset but the principals are the same. For a basket analysis, we need to calculate support, confidence and lift. 

Support is the frequency of the products being bought.
Confidence is the % of transactions that contain the 2 products together.
Lift is the strength of the relationship of the 2 products.

The dashboard is interactive and allows the user to select a product and compare relationships of that product with other products.
